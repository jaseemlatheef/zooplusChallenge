## Getting Started

Welcome to the Zooplus automation framework. It is based on Selenium with Java and follow a page factory approach. 

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

Src contains two packages namely page classes and test classes
Page Classes contain the elementRepo.java file which contains the element identifier values in a page factory model and the function definitions. 
Test Classes contain App.java which contain main function where it contains the test cases and function calls.
